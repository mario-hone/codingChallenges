# Start with any integer between 00 and 99, inclusive, written as two digits (use a leading zero if the number is less than 10).
# Add the two digits together. Now concatenate the rightmost digit of the first number with the rightmost digit of the sum to get a new number.
# If you repeat this process enough times, you'll end up back at the original number.

def cycleLength(n):

    #take number and turn it into a list

    #loop until original list and new list are the same

        #add the two individual elements

        # get the rightmost value of new number
        # take the new numbers rightmost value and combine it into a list with
        # the previous' list value

        # if the newly created list compares to the original list, end loop


    return 1
