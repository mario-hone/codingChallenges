# Start with any integer between 00 and 99, inclusive, written as two digits (use a leading zero if the number is less than 10).
# Add the two digits together. Now concatenate the rightmost digit of the first number with the rightmost digit of the sum to get a new number.
# If you repeat this process enough times, you'll end up back at the original number.
